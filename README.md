Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Answer:

The process of designing, developing and testing applications to solve pronlems by following set principles and best practices.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Answer:

Traditional programming is more focused on coding, where in software engineering focuses on the entire development cycle. From idea, design, conception and maintenance. In software engineering, engineers are involved in all stages of the cycle.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Answer:

Waterfall Model:
Requirements - The first step where a client or product manager define the requirements for the software
Design - This is the second step and it where the requirements are analysed and turned into designs or flows 
Develop - At this step the developers start with the development of the product or feature based on the approved designs 
Test - The product or feature is then tested against the design and requierements and to check for any faults, bugs or crashes 
Deploy - Once testing is done and has been polished and approved, develoyment takes place and the app or platform is made available 
Maintenance - The platformed is then maintained, to ensure no issues and time to time improvements or updates 

The waterfall is more rigid, sticks to a timeline and offeres little adapdability compared to Agile. Agile is more versatile and makes room for interations. Although the steps within each of these are the same.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

Answer:

Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach to software development with fixed scope and extensive upfront documentation, delivering the final product only at the end. In contrast, Agile is iterative and incremental, allowing for flexibility and continuous adaptation, with lightweight documentation and frequent delivery of working product increments. Waterfall is predictable and structured, making it suitable for projects with well-defined requirements, while Agile thrives in environments needing rapid iteration and ongoing stakeholder collaboration. Waterfall struggles with accommodating changes, whereas Agile is designed to embrace and respond to change. The choice between the two depends on project needs, team dynamics, and organizational culture. (ChatGPT)

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Answer:

This is the process of defining, documenting and maintaining the requirements during the design. It is writing down user, business and system requirements. This process is important for everyone involoved in the project because it ensures alignment in terms of expectations and gives an overview of the project.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Answer:

It is a concept that approaches design in a way that a complex system is divided into smaller modules to make it more manageable. Each module or component handles a particular feature. This process promotes a clear division of labour, allowing developers to focus on the portions of the system rather than being overwhelmed by the entire system (institute  of data). This allows for developers to develop systems quicker with less issues. 

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

Answer:

Software testing is a critical aspect of the software development process, ensuring that applications function correctly, meet requirements, and provide a quality user experience. There are several levels of software testing, each serving a specific purpose:

Unit Testing: Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions of a software application in isolation. These components, often referred to as units, are the smallest testable parts of an application, such as functions, methods, or classes.

Integration Testing: Integration testing focuses on verifying the interactions and data flow between different modules or components of an application. This level of testing is performed after unit tests have been successfully executed.

System Testing: System testing evaluates the complete and integrated software system as a whole. It aims to validate the end-to-end system specifications and is conducted in an environment that closely mirrors production.

Acceptance Testing: Acceptance testing is conducted to determine whether the system meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment. It is often the final level of testing and is typically performed by end-users or clients.

Importance of Testing in Software Development
Error Detection
Quality Assuranc
Customer Satisfaction
Risk Mitigation
Continuous Improvement
Compliance

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Answer:

A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps manage changes to source code over time. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, keeps track of every modification to the code, and provides mechanisms to merge, track, and roll back changes when necessary. (ChatGPT)

Some popular VCS tools include:  Git, Subversion, Mercurial and Perforce

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Answer:

A software project manager plays a pivotal role in navigating the complexities of software development projects. Their responsibilities encompass a wide range of activities, from planning and team management to communication, risk management, and quality assurance. The challenges they face, such as scope creep, unrealistic deadlines, and resource constraints, require a combination of strategic planning, effective communication, and proactive problem-solving to ensure project success. (ChatGPT)

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

Answer:

This process ensures that software systems remain functional, secure, and relevant over time. It involves various activities like correcting faults, adapting to new environments, enhancing performance, and preventing future issues. Ethical considerations in software engineering emphasize the importance of privacy, security, transparency, fairness, and social responsibility, ensuring that software development practices align with broader societal values and expectations.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Answer:

There is a number of ethical issues related to privacy, security, intellectual property, bias, transparency, and social responsibility. Adhering to ethical standards involves following established codes of ethics, implementing best practices for privacy and security, respecting intellectual property rights, avoiding bias, ensuring transparency, and committing to continuous learning. By integrating these practices into their work, software engineers can ensure they develop software that is ethical, reliable, and beneficial to society.
